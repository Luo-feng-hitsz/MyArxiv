Still, despite being pretrained on extensive data, they\nbecome outdated over time. To keep models updated, research into continual\npretraining mainly explores scenarios with either (1) infrequent,\nindiscriminate updates on large-scale new data, or (2) frequent, sample-level\nupdates. However, practical model deployment often operates in the gap between\nthese two limit cases, as real-world applications often demand adaptation to\nspecific subdomains, tasks or concepts -- spread over the entire, varying life\ncycle of a model. In this work, we complement current perspectives on continual\npretraining through a research test bed as well as provide comprehensive\nguidance for effective continual model updates in such scenarios. We first\nintroduce FoMo-in-Flux, a continual multimodal pretraining benchmark with\nrealistic compute constraints and practical deployment requirements,\nconstructed over 63 datasets with diverse visual and semantic coverage. Using\nFoMo-in-Flux, we explore the complex landscape of practical continual\npretraining through multiple perspectives: (1) A data-centric investigation of\ndata mixtures and stream orderings that emulate real-world deployment\nsituations, (2) a method-centric investigation ranging from simple fine-tuning\nand traditional continual learning strategies to parameter-efficient updates\nand model merging, (3) meta learning rate schedules and mechanistic design\nchoices, and (4) the influence of model and compute scaling. Together, our\ninsights provide a practitioner's guide to continual multimodal pretraining for\nreal-world deployment.

A class of parameter-efficient fine-tuning\n(PEFT) aims to mitigate these computational challenges by selectively\nfine-tuning only a small fraction of the model parameters. Although\ncomputationally efficient, these techniques often fail to match the performance\nof fully fine-tuned models, primarily due to inherent biases introduced during\nparameter selection. Traditional selective PEFT techniques use a fixed set of\nparameters based on a predefined budget (a process also known as unmasking),\nfailing to capture parameter importance dynamically and often ending up\nexceeding the budget. We introduce $\\text{ID}^3$, a novel selective PEFT method\nthat calculates parameter importance continually and dynamically unmasks\nparameters by balancing exploration and exploitation in parameter selection.\nOur empirical study on 15 tasks spanning natural language understanding and\ngenerative tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method compared to\nfixed-masking-based PEFT techniques. We analytically show that $\\text{ID}^3$\nreduces the number of gradient updates by a factor of two, enhancing\ncomputational efficiency. $\\text{ID}^3$ is robust to random initialization of\nneurons and, therefore, can be seamlessly integrated into existing additive and\nreparametrization-based PEFT modules such as adapters and LoRA for dynamic\nsparsification.\n","authors":["Aradhye Agarwal","Suhas K Ramesh","Ayan Sengupta","Tanmoy Chakraborty"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14470v1.pdf","comment":"15 pages, 7 tables, 9 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14467v1","updated":"2024-08-26T17:58:17Z","published":"2024-08-26T17:58:17Z","title":"Explicit Inductive Inference using Large Language Models","summary":"  Large Language Models (LLMs) are reported to hold undesirable attestation\nbias on inference tasks: when asked to predict if a premise P entails a\nhypothesis H, instead of considering H's conditional truthfulness entailed by\nP, LLMs tend to use the out-of-context truth label of H as a fragile proxy.

Our empirical analysis shows that the proposed diversity\ncoefficient aligns with the intuitive properties of diversity and variability,\ne.g., it increases as the number of latent concepts increases. Then, we measure\nthe diversity coefficient of publicly available pre-training datasets and\ndemonstrate that their formal diversity is high compared to theoretical lower\nand upper bounds. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive set of controlled\ninterventional experiments with GPT-2 and LLaMAv2 that demonstrate the\ndiversity coefficient of pre-training data characterizes useful aspects of\ndownstream model evaluation performance -- totaling 44 models of various sizes\n(51M to 7B parameters).

To address this issue, we propose Heuristically\nAdjusted IF (HAIF), which reduces the weight of tokens with large gradient\nnorms, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of tracing the most\ninfluential samples. To establish easily obtained groundtruth for tracing\nprivacy leakage, we construct two datasets, PII-E and PII-CR, representing two\ndistinct scenarios: one with identical text in the model outputs and\npre-training data, and the other where models leverage their reasoning\nabilities to generate text divergent from pre-training data.

Fused Deposition\nModeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized,\ncost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer\nextrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods.\nHowever, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often\nrequires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely\ncompromise product quality. While automated error detection and machine\nlearning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups,\nfirmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive\nlabeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability. To address these\nchallenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that\nleverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to\ndetect and address printing defects. The LLM evaluates print quality by\nanalyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying\nfailure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters. It then\ngenerates and executes a corrective action plan. We validated the effectiveness\nof the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a\ncontrol group of engineers with diverse AM expertise. Our evaluation\ndemonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D\nprinting errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer\nadhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures\nand autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention.\n","authors":["Yayati Jadhav","Peter Pak","Amir Barati Farimani"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14307v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10594v3","updated":"2024-08-26T14:30:38Z","published":"2024-06-15T11:03:33Z","title":"BlockPruner: Fine-grained Pruning for Large Language Models","summary":"  With the rapid growth in the size and complexity of large language models\n(LLMs), the costs associated with their training and inference have escalated\nsignificantly.

While various layer pruning methods have been developed\nbased on this insight, they generally overlook the finer-grained redundancies\nwithin the layers themselves. In this paper, we delve deeper into the\narchitecture of LLMs and demonstrate that finer-grained pruning can be achieved\nby targeting redundancies in multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer\nperceptron (MLP) blocks. We propose a novel, training-free structured pruning\napproach called BlockPruner. Unlike existing layer pruning methods, BlockPruner\nsegments each Transformer layer into MHA and MLP blocks. It then assesses the\nimportance of these blocks using perplexity measures and applies a heuristic\nsearch for iterative pruning.

Nonetheless,\nthese new data-intensive methods introduce language-dependent disparities in\nNLG as the main training data sets are in English. Also, most neural NLG\nsystems use decoder-only (causal) transformer language models, which work well\nfor English, but were not designed with other languages in mind. In this work\nwe depart from the hypothesis that they may introduce generation bias in target\nlanguages with less rigid word ordering, subject omission, or different\nattachment preferences for relative clauses, so that for these target languages\nother language generation strategies may be more desirable. This paper first\ncompares causal and non-causal language modeling for English and Spanish, two\nlanguages with different grammatical structures and over 1.5 billion and 0.5\nbillion speakers, respectively. For this purpose, we define a novel metric of\naverage causal and non-causal context-conditioned entropy of the grammatical\ncategory distribution for both languages as an information-theoretic a priori\napproach. The evaluation of natural text sources (such as training data) in\nboth languages reveals lower average non-causal conditional entropy in Spanish\nand lower causal conditional entropy in English. According to this experiment,\nSpanish is more predictable than English given a non-causal context. Then, by\napplying a conditional relative entropy metric to text generation experiments,\nwe obtain as insights that the best performance is respectively achieved with\ncausal NLG in English, and with non-causal NLG in Spanish. These insights\nsupport further research in NLG in Spanish using bidirectional transformer\nlanguage models.\n","authors":["Andrea Busto-Castiñeira","Francisco J.

Recently, numerous\nstudies have attempted to compress LLMs using one-shot pruning methods.\nHowever, these methods often experience considerable performance degradation on\ncomplex language understanding tasks, calling into question the feasibility of\npruning in LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a pruning pipeline for\nsemi-structured sparse models via retraining, termed Adaptive Sparse Trainer\n(AST). Unlike previous one-shot pruning methods, AST incrementally transforms\ndense models into sparse ones by applying decay to masked weights while\nallowing the model to adaptively select masks throughout the training process.\nFurthermore, we observe that using distillation with a dense model as the\nteacher can prevent the sparse model from falling into local optima and\naccelerate convergence. In addition, we incorporate extra well-initialized\nparameters to further enhance model performance with minimal increase in memory\nfootprint. AST can significantly enhance model performance, approaching the\nlevel of dense models. When applied to the LLaMA2-7B model, AST reduces the\nzero-shot accuracy gap between dense and semi-structured sparse models to 1.12%\nacross multiple zero-shot tasks, utilizing less than 0.4% of the pretraining\ntokens.

In this paper, we propose StateFlow, a\nnovel LLM-based task-solving paradigm that conceptualizes complex task-solving\nprocesses as state machines. In StateFlow, we distinguish between \"process\ngrounding\" (via state and state transitions) and \"sub-task solving\" (through\nactions within a state), enhancing control and interpretability of the\ntask-solving procedure. A state represents the status of a running process. The\ntransitions between states are controlled by heuristic rules or decisions made\nby the LLM, allowing for a dynamic and adaptive progression. Upon entering a\nstate, a series of actions is executed, involving not only calling LLMs guided\nby different prompts, but also the utilization of external tools as needed. Our\nresults show that StateFlow significantly enhances LLMs' efficiency. For\ninstance, StateFlow achieves 13% and 28% higher success rates compared to ReAct\nin InterCode SQL and ALFWorld benchmark, with 5x and 3x less cost respectively.\nWe also show that StateFlow can be combined with iterative refining methods\nlike Reflexion to further improve performance.\n","authors":["Yiran Wu","Tianwei Yue","Shaokun Zhang","Chi Wang","Qingyun Wu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11322v4.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03624v2","updated":"2024-08-26T08:09:39Z","published":"2024-07-04T04:19:50Z","title":"Question-Analysis Prompting Improves LLM Performance in Reasoning Tasks","summary":"  Although LLMs have the potential to transform many fields, they still\nunderperform humans in reasoning tasks.

Although deep learning based models have shown promising results\nover the past decade, their reliance on extensive private mobility data for\ntraining and their inability to perform zero-shot predictions, have hindered\nfurther advancements. Recently, attempts have been made to apply large language\nmodels (LLMs) to mobility prediction task. However, their performance has been\nconstrained by the absence of a systematic design of workflow. They directly\ngenerate the final output using LLMs, which limits the potential of LLMs to\nuncover complex mobility patterns and underestimates their extensive reserve of\nglobal geospatial knowledge. In this paper, we introduce AgentMove, a\nsystematic agentic prediction framework to achieve generalized mobility\nprediction for any cities worldwide. In AgentMove, we first decompose the\nmobility prediction task into three sub-tasks and then design corresponding\nmodules to complete these subtasks, including spatial-temporal memory for\nindividual mobility pattern mining, world knowledge generator for modeling the\neffects of urban structure and collective knowledge extractor for capturing the\nshared patterns among population. Finally, we combine the results of three\nmodules and conduct a reasoning step to generate the final predictions.\nExtensive experiments on mobility data from two sources in 12 cities\ndemonstrate that AgentMove outperforms the best baseline more than 8% in\nvarious metrics and it shows robust predictions with various LLMs as base and\nalso less geographical bias across cities.

The face images are synthetic and are\nsystematically and independently varied along six dimensions: the legally\nprotected attributes of age, gender, and race, as well as facial expression,\nlighting, and pose. Independently and systematically manipulating face\nattributes allows us to study the effect of each on social perception and\navoids confounds that can occur in wild-collected data due to uncontrolled\nsystematic correlations between attributes. Thus, our findings are experimental\nrather than observational. Our main findings are three.

Existing removal methods still\nstruggle to eliminate implicit concepts primarily due to their dependency on\nthe model's ability to recognize concepts it actually can not discern. To\naddress this, we utilize the intrinsic geometric characteristics of implicit\nconcepts and present the Geom-Erasing, a novel concept removal method based on\nthe geometric-driven control. Specifically, once an unwanted implicit concept\nis identified, we integrate the existence and geometric information of the\nconcept into the text prompts with the help of an accessible classifier or\ndetector model. Subsequently, the model is optimized to identify and\ndisentangle this information, which is then adopted as negative prompts during\ngeneration. Moreover, we introduce the Implicit Concept Dataset (ICD), a novel\nimage-text dataset imbued with three typical implicit concepts (i.e., QR codes,\nwatermarks, and text), reflecting real-life situations where implicit concepts\nare easily injected.

Fetal tractography\nfaces unique difficulties due to low dMRI signal quality, immature and rapidly\ndeveloping brain structures, and paucity of reference data. This work presents\nthe first machine learning model for fetal tractography. The model input\nconsists of five sources of information: (1) Fiber orientation, inferred from a\ndiffusion tensor fit to the dMRI signal; (2) Directions of recent propagation\nsteps; (3) Global spatial information, encoded as distances to keypoints in the\nbrain cortex; (4) Tissue segmentation information; and (5) Prior information\nabout the expected local fiber orientations supplied with an atlas. In order to\nmitigate the local tensor estimation error, a large spatial context around the\ncurrent point in the diffusion tensor image is encoded using convolutional and\nattention neural network modules. Moreover, the diffusion tensor information at\na hypothetical next point is included in the model input. Filtering rules based\non anatomically constrained tractography are applied to prune implausible\nstreamlines. We trained the model on manually-refined whole-brain fetal\ntractograms and validated the trained model on an independent set of 11 test\nscans with gestational ages between 23 and 36 weeks. Results show that our\nproposed method achieves superior performance across all evaluated tracts.

Instead of object-centered coordinate system, current methods\ngeneralized global priors learned in seen classes to reconstruct 3D shapes from\nunseen classes in viewer-centered coordinate system. However, the\nreconstruction accuracy and interpretability are still eager to get improved.\nTo resolve this issue, we introduce to learn local pattern modularization for\nreconstructing 3D shapes in unseen classes, which achieves both good\ngeneralization ability and high reconstruction accuracy. Our insight is to\nlearn a local prior which is class-agnostic and easy to generalize in\nobject-centered coordinate system.

This paper addresses the\nfact that not all channels of the feature map extracted from a self-supervised\nbackbone contain sufficient information for instance segmentation purposes. In\nfact, Some channels are noisy and hinder the accuracy of the task. To overcome\nthis issue, this paper proposes two channel reduction modules: Noise Channel\nReduction (NCR) and Deviation-based Channel Reduction (DCR). The NCR retains\nchannels with lower entropy, as they are less likely to be noisy, while DCR\nprunes channels with low standard deviation, as they lack sufficient\ninformation for effective instance segmentation.

Basic data augmentation techniques\ncommonly applied to natural images in computer vision may not be suitable for\nart images in aesthetic evaluation tasks, as they can change the composition of\nthe art images. In this paper, we explore the impact of local and global data\naugmentation techniques on artistic image aesthetic assessment (IAA). We\nintroduce BackFlip, a local data augmentation technique designed specifically\nfor artistic IAA. We evaluate the performance of BackFlip across three artistic\nimage datasets and four neural network architectures, comparing it with the\ncommonly used data augmentation techniques. Then, we analyze the effects of\ncomponents within the BackFlip pipeline through an ablation study. Our findings\ndemonstrate that local augmentations, such as BackFlip, tend to outperform\nglobal augmentations on artistic IAA in most cases, probably because they do\nnot perturb the composition of the art images. These results emphasize the\nimportance of considering both local and global augmentations in future\ncomputational aesthetics research.\n","authors":["Ombretta Strafforello","Gonzalo Muradas Odriozola","Fatemeh Behrad","Li-Wei Chen","Anne-Sofie Maerten","Derya Soydaner","Johan Wagemans"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14173v1.pdf","comment":"Published at the VISART VII workshop at ECCV 2024.

Using glioma data from 1172\npatients, we developed VASARI-auto, an automated labelling software applied to\nboth open-source lesion masks and our openly available tumour segmentation\nmodel. In parallel, two consultant neuroradiologists independently quantified\nVASARI features in a subsample of 100 glioblastoma cases.

Tumour segmentation was compatible with the\ncurrent state of the art and equally performant regardless of age or sex. A\nmodest inter-rater variability between in-house neuroradiologists was\ncomparable to between neuroradiologists and VASARI-auto, with far higher\nagreement between VASARI-auto methods. The time taken for neuroradiologists to\nderive VASARI was substantially higher than VASARI-auto (mean time per case 317\nvs. 3 seconds).

Qualitative examination of the reconstructions\nsuggests that the image prior applied by a diffusion method strongly favors\nreconstructions that are like real images -- so have straight shadow\nboundaries, curved specularities and no fireflies.\n","authors":["Vaibhav Vavilala","Rahul Vasanth","David Forsyth"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00491v2.pdf","comment":"25 pages, 18 figures, 2 tables"}],"Information Retrieval":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14432v1","updated":"2024-08-26T17:20:34Z","published":"2024-08-26T17:20:34Z","title":"Contextual Bandit with Herding Effects: Algorithms and Recommendation\n  Applications","summary":"  Contextual bandits serve as a fundamental algorithmic framework for\noptimizing recommendation decisions online.

Some studies have observed that LLMs, when fine-tuned\nby the cross-entropy (CE) loss with a full softmax, could achieve\n`state-of-the-art' performance in sequential recommendation. However, most of\nthe baselines used for comparison are trained using a pointwise/pairwise loss\nfunction. This inconsistent experimental setting leads to the underestimation\nof traditional methods and further fosters over-confidence in the ranking\ncapability of LLMs.\n  In this study, we provide theoretical justification for the superiority of\nthe cross-entropy loss by demonstrating its two desirable properties: tightness\nand coverage. Furthermore, this study sheds light on additional novel insights:\n1) Taking into account only the recommendation performance, CE is not yet\noptimal as it is not a quite tight bound in terms of some ranking metrics. 2)\nIn scenarios that full softmax cannot be performed, an effective alternative is\nto scale up the sampled normalizing term. These findings then help unleash the\npotential of traditional recommendation models, allowing them to surpass\nLLM-based counterparts.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)\ncaptures whole-brain activity noninvasively, and modeling how fMRI signals\ninteract with physiological dynamics of the body can provide new insight into\nbrain function and offer potential biomarkers of disease. However,\nphysiological recordings are not always possible to acquire since they require\nextra equipment and setup, and even when they are, the recorded physiological\nsignals may contain substantial artifacts. To overcome this limitation, machine\nlearning models have been proposed to directly extract features of respiratory\nand cardiac activity from resting-state fMRI signals. To date, such work has\nbeen carried out only in healthy young adults and in a pediatric population,\nleaving open questions about the efficacy of these approaches on older adults.\nHere, we propose a novel framework that leverages Transformer-based\narchitectures for reconstructing two key physiological signals - low-frequency\nrespiratory volume (RV) and heart rate (HR) fluctuations - from fMRI data, and\ntest these models on a dataset of individuals aged 36-89 years old. Our\nframework outperforms previously proposed approaches (attaining median\ncorrelations between predicted and measured signals of r ~ .698 for RV and r ~\n.618 for HR), indicating the potential of leveraging attention mechanisms to\nmodel fMRI-physiological signal relationships. We also evaluate several model\ntraining and fine-tuning strategies, and find that incorporating young-adult\ndata during training improves the performance when predicting physiological\nsignals in the aging cohort. Overall, our approach successfully infers key\nphysiological variables directly from fMRI data from individuals across a wide\nrange of the adult lifespan.\n","authors":["Shiyu Wang","Ziyuan Xu","Yamin Li","Mara Mather","Roza G.

Our\ntextual prompts are constructed from well-validated social psychology terms\ndenoting social perception. The face images are synthetic and are\nsystematically and independently varied along six dimensions: the legally\nprotected attributes of age, gender, and race, as well as facial expression,\nlighting, and pose. Independently and systematically manipulating face\nattributes allows us to study the effect of each on social perception and\navoids confounds that can occur in wild-collected data due to uncontrolled\nsystematic correlations between attributes. Thus, our findings are experimental\nrather than observational. Our main findings are three. First, while CLIP is\ntrained on the widest variety of images and texts, it is able to make\nfine-grained human-like social judgments on face images. Second, age, gender,\nand race do systematically impact CLIP's social perception of faces, suggesting\nan undesirable bias in CLIP vis-a-vis legally protected attributes. Most\nstrikingly, we find a strong pattern of bias concerning the faces of Black\nwomen, where CLIP produces extreme values of social perception across different\nages and facial expressions. Third, facial expression impacts social perception\nmore than age and lighting as much as age.

Fetal tractography\nfaces unique difficulties due to low dMRI signal quality, immature and rapidly\ndeveloping brain structures, and paucity of reference data.

In this study, we address the problem of CL under Noisy Labels\n(CLN) by introducing Alternate Experience Replay (AER), which takes advantage\nof forgetting to maintain a clear distinction between clean, complex, and noisy\nsamples in the memory buffer. The idea is that complex or mislabeled examples,\nwhich hardly fit the previously learned data distribution, are most likely to\nbe forgotten. To grasp the benefits of such a separation, we equip AER with\nAsymmetric Balanced Sampling (ABS): a new sample selection strategy that\nprioritizes purity on the current task while retaining relevant samples from\nthe past.

However, this assumption limits the effectiveness of GNNs in handling\nheterophilic graphs where connected nodes often exhibit dissimilar\ncharacteristics. Existing approaches for homophily graphs such as non-local\nneighbor extension and architectural refinement overlook the rich textual data\nassociated with nodes, which could unlock deeper insights into these\nheterophilic contexts. With advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), there\nis significant promise to enhance GNNs by leveraging the extensive open-world\nknowledge within LLMs to more effectively interpret and utilize textual data\nfor characterizing heterophilic graphs.

Subsequently, we introduce an innovative approach to model fusion\ncalled zero-shot Sparse MIxture of Low-rank Experts (SMILE) construction, which\nallows for the upscaling of source models into an MoE model without extra data\nor further training.

Deep reinforcement learning, which\ntakes advantage of the exploratory aspects of reinforcement learning (RL) and\nthe rich nonlinearity of a deep neural network, provides a promising approach\nto discover feasible control strategies. However, the typical model-free\napproach to reinforcement learning requires a significant amount of interaction\nbetween the flow environment and the RL agent during training, and this high\ntraining cost impedes its development and application. In this work, we propose\na model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) approach by incorporating a novel\nreduced-order model as a surrogate for the full environment. The model consists\nof a physics-augmented autoencoder, which compresses high-dimensional CFD flow\nfield snaphsots into a three-dimensional latent space, and a latent dynamics\nmodel that is trained to accurately predict the long-time dynamics of\ntrajectories in the latent space in response to action sequences. The\nrobustness and generalizability of the model is demonstrated in two distinct\nflow environments, a pitching airfoil in a highly disturbed environment and a\nvertical-axis wind turbine in a disturbance-free environment. Based on the\ntrained model in the first problem, we realize an MBRL strategy to mitigate\nlift variation during gust-airfoil encounters.

We\nintroduce Confidence-Driven Inference: a method that combines LLM annotations\nand LLM confidence indicators to strategically select which human annotations\nshould be collected, with the goal of producing accurate statistical estimates\nand provably valid confidence intervals while reducing the number of human\nannotations needed. Our approach comes with safeguards against LLM annotations\nof poor quality, guaranteeing that the conclusions will be both valid and no\nless accurate than if we only relied on human annotations. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of Confidence-Driven Inference over baselines in statistical\nestimation tasks across three CSS settings--text politeness, stance, and\nbias--reducing the needed number of human annotations by over 25% in each.\nAlthough we use CSS settings for demonstration, Confidence-Driven Inference can\nbe used to estimate most standard quantities across a broad range of NLP\nproblems.\n","authors":["Kristina Gligorić","Tijana Zrnic","Cinoo Lee","Emmanuel J.

However, a critical concern is the\npresence of toxic content within the pre-training corpus of these models, which\ncan lead to the generation of inappropriate outputs. Investigating methods for\ndetecting internal faults in LLMs can help us understand their limitations and\nimprove their security. Existing methods primarily focus on jailbreaking\nattacks, which involve manually or automatically constructing adversarial\ncontent to prompt the target LLM to generate unexpected responses. These\nmethods rely heavily on prompt engineering, which is time-consuming and usually\nrequires specially designed questions. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes a target-driven attack paradigm that focuses on directly eliciting the\ntarget response instead of optimizing the prompts. We introduce the use of\nanother LLM as the detector for toxic content, referred to as ToxDet. Given a\ntarget toxic response, ToxDet can generate a possible question and a\npreliminary answer to provoke the target model into producing desired toxic\nresponses with meanings equivalent to the provided one. ToxDet is trained by\ninteracting with the target LLM and receiving reward signals from it, utilizing\nreinforcement learning for the optimization process. While the primary focus of\nthe target models is on open-source LLMs, the fine-tuned ToxDet can also be\ntransferred to attack black-box models such as GPT-4o, achieving notable\nresults. Experimental results on AdvBench and HH-Harmless datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our methods in detecting the tendencies of target LLMs to\ngenerate harmful responses.

However, it is perhaps more\ncommon than not for jailbreak developers to substantially exaggerate the\neffectiveness of their jailbreaks. We suggest this problem arises because\njailbreak researchers lack a standard, high-quality benchmark for evaluating\njailbreak performance, leaving researchers to create their own. To create a\nbenchmark, researchers must choose a dataset of forbidden prompts to which a\nvictim model will respond, along with an evaluation method that scores the\nharmfulness of the victim model's responses. We show that existing benchmarks\nsuffer from significant shortcomings and introduce the StrongREJECT benchmark\nto address these issues. StrongREJECT's dataset contains prompts that victim\nmodels must answer with specific, harmful information, while its automated\nevaluator measures the extent to which a response gives useful information to\nforbidden prompts. In doing so, the StrongREJECT evaluator achieves\nstate-of-the-art agreement with human judgments of jailbreak effectiveness.\nNotably, we find that existing evaluation methods significantly overstate\njailbreak effectiveness compared to human judgments and the StrongREJECT\nevaluator.

It is trained on 180k hours of\npublic audio data for multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech\ntranslation (ST), and language identification (LID). Compared to\nencoder-decoder OWSM, our OWSM-CTC achieves competitive results on ASR and up\nto 24% relative improvement on ST, while it is more robust and 3 to 4 times\nfaster for inference. OWSM-CTC also improves the long-form ASR result with 20x\nspeed-up.

To minimize such a need,\ntask-generic promptable segmentation has been introduced, which employs a\nsingle task-generic prompt to segment various images of different objects in\nthe same task. Current methods use Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to\nreason detailed instance-specific prompts from a task-generic prompt for\nimproving segmentation accuracy.

Furthermore, we notice\nthat, as empirical results shown in the literature, even when the visual\nappearance of objects is removed, object bounding boxes alone, instead of being\ndirectly fed into the network, can indirectly provide sufficient position\ninformation via the Region of Interest Pooling operation for dynamics\nprediction.

In this work we propose DIFR3CT, a\n3D latent diffusion model, that can generate a distribution of plausible CT\nvolumes from one or few (<10) planar x-ray observations. DIFR3CT works by\nfusing 2D features from each x-ray into a joint 3D space, and performing\ndiffusion conditioned on these fused features in a low-dimensional latent\nspace.

Existing\nframeworks, such as those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),\nattention, and selective scan space state sequential model (SSM), lack\nsufficient flexibility and scalability in fusing diverse features, and cannot\neffectively fuse diverse features. Additionally, current approaches do not\nadequately exploit order-related and order-independent features, resulting in\nsuboptimal utilization of sequence information. To address these limitations,\nwe propose a novel MIL framework called Mamba2MIL.

Clinically,\nwe observed that sonographers adjust their understanding of a patient's cardiac\nstructure based on prior scanning sequences, thereby modifying their scanning\nstrategies. Inspired by this, we propose a sequence-aware self-supervised\npre-training method.

We hypothesize that if the model can predict the missing\ncontent it has acquired a good understanding of the personalized cardiac\nstructure. In the downstream probe guidance task, we also introduced a sequence\nmodeling approach that models individual cardiac structural information based\non the images and actions from historical scan data, enabling more accurate\nnavigation decisions.

Consequently, there\nhas been a trend towards increasing the scale of models. However, this trend\nintroduces significant challenges, including substantial computational costs of\ntraining and transfer to downstream tasks. To address these issues,\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been introduced. These\nmethods optimize large-scale pre-trained models for specific tasks by\nfine-tuning a select group of parameters. Among these PEFT methods,\nadapter-based and prompt-based methods are the primary techniques.\nSpecifically, in the field of visual fine-tuning, adapters gain prominence over\nprompts because of the latter's relatively weaker performance and efficiency.\nUnder the circumstances, we refine the widely-used Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT)\nmethod, proposing Cross Visual Prompt Tuning (CVPT). CVPT calculates\ncross-attention between the prompt tokens and the embedded tokens, which allows\nus to compute the semantic relationship between them and conduct the\nfine-tuning of models exactly to adapt visual tasks better. Furthermore, we\nintroduce the weight-sharing mechanism to initialize the parameters of\ncross-attention, which avoids massive learnable parameters from cross-attention\nand enhances the representative capability of cross-attention. We conduct\ncomprehensive testing across 25 datasets and the result indicates that CVPT\nsignificantly improves VPT's performance and efficiency in visual tasks.

To this end, existing works have demonstrated remarkable\nperformance by utilizing global visual features from Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) for visual-semantic interactions.\nDue to the limited receptive fields of CNNs and the quadratic complexity of\nViTs, however, these visual backbones achieve suboptimal visual-semantic\ninteractions. In this paper, motivated by the visual state space model (i.e.,\nVision Mamba), which is capable of capturing long-range dependencies and\nmodeling complex visual dynamics, we propose a parameter-efficient ZSL\nframework called ZeroMamba to advance ZSL. Our ZeroMamba comprises three key\ncomponents: Semantic-aware Local Projection (SLP), Global Representation\nLearning (GRL), and Semantic Fusion (SeF). Specifically, SLP integrates\nsemantic embeddings to map visual features to local semantic-related\nrepresentations, while GRL encourages the model to learn global semantic\nrepresentations. SeF combines these two semantic representations to enhance the\ndiscriminability of semantic features. We incorporate these designs into Vision\nMamba, forming an end-to-end ZSL framework. As a result, the learned semantic\nrepresentations are better suited for classification. Through extensive\nexperiments on four prominent ZSL benchmarks, ZeroMamba demonstrates superior\nperformance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art (i.e., CNN-based\nand ViT-based) methods under both conventional ZSL (CZSL) and generalized ZSL\n(GZSL) settings.

Layout control has been widely studied to\nalleviate the shortcomings of T2I diffusion models in understanding objects'\nplacement and relationships from text descriptions. Nevertheless, existing\napproaches for layout control are limited to 2D layouts, require the user to\nprovide a static layout beforehand, and fail to preserve generated images under\nlayout changes. This makes these approaches unsuitable for applications that\nrequire 3D object-wise control and iterative refinements, e.g., interior design\nand complex scene generation. To this end, we leverage the recent advancements\nin depth-conditioned T2I models and propose a novel approach for interactive 3D\nlayout control. We replace the traditional 2D boxes used in layout control with\n3D boxes. Furthermore, we revamp the T2I task as a multi-stage generation\nprocess, where at each stage, the user can insert, change, and move an object\nin 3D while preserving objects from earlier stages. We achieve this through our\nproposed Dynamic Self-Attention (DSA) module and the consistent 3D object\ntranslation strategy.

Since existing prompt tuning methods\ngive little consideration to managing structured knowledge, this paper\nadvocates leveraging LLMs to construct a graph for each description to\nprioritize such structured knowledge.

However, current PaI methods still have a large accuracy gap with\niterative pruning, especially at high sparsity levels. This raises an\nintriguing question: can we get inspiration from iterative pruning to improve\nthe PaI performance? In the lottery ticket hypothesis, the iterative rewind\npruning (IRP) finds subnetworks retroactively by rewinding the parameter to the\noriginal initialization in every pruning iteration, which means all the\nsubnetworks are based on the initial state. Here, we hypothesise the surviving\nsubnetworks are more important and bridge the initial feature and their\nsurviving score as the PaI criterion.

To validate the accuracy and generalization of our method, we\nperformed PaI across various models. Results show that our approach outperforms\nexisting methods in high-sparsity settings.

The representation\ncombines the benefits of both implicit neural representations and explicit\nspatial octrees and is learned with an octree-based variational autoencoder.\nThe proposed diffusion model is a unified multi-scale U-Net that enables\nweights and computation sharing across different octree levels and avoids the\ncomplexity of widely used cascaded diffusion schemes. We verify the\neffectiveness of OctFusion on the ShapeNet and Objaverse datasets and achieve\nstate-of-the-art performances on shape generation tasks. We demonstrate that\nOctFusion is extendable and flexible by generating high-quality color fields\nfor textured mesh generation and high-quality 3D shapes conditioned on text\nprompts, sketches, or category labels.

Existing 3D\nreconstruction methods from sparse inputs still struggle with capturing\nintricate geometric details and can suffer from limitations in handling\noccluded regions. On the other hand, NeRFs excel in modeling complex scenes but\ndo not offer means to extract meaningful geometry. Our proposed method offers\nthe best of both worlds by transferring the information encoded in NeRF\nfeatures to derive an accurate occupancy field representation. We utilize a\npre-trained, generalizable state-of-the-art NeRF network to capture detailed\nscene radiance information, and rapidly transfer this knowledge to train a\ngeneralizable implicit occupancy network. This process helps in leveraging the\nknowledge of the scene geometry encoded in the generalizable NeRF prior and\nrefining it to learn occupancy fields, facilitating a more precise\ngeneralizable representation of 3D space. The transfer learning approach leads\nto a dramatic reduction in training time, by orders of magnitude (i.e. from\nseveral days to 3.5 hrs), obviating the need to train generalizable sparse\nsurface reconstruction methods from scratch. Additionally, we introduce a novel\nloss on volumetric rendering weights that helps in the learning of accurate\noccupancy fields, along with a normal loss that helps in global smoothing of\nthe occupancy fields. We evaluate our approach on the DTU dataset and\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy,\nespecially in challenging scenarios with sparse input data and occluded\nregions.

Classical\nfew-shot benchmarks make use of few-shot samples from a single modality, but\nsuch samples may not be sufficient to characterize an entire concept class.

To do so, we exploit the fact that recent multimodal foundation models\nsuch as CLIP learn cross-modal encoders that map different modalities to the\nsame representation space. Specifically, we propose a simple strategy for ${\\bf\ncross-modal}$ ${\\bf adaptation}$: we treat examples from different modalities\nas additional few-shot examples.

While additive noise input during network\ntraining is a well-established augmentation as regularization method, modern\npipelines often favor more robust techniques such as dropout and weight decay.\nThis preference stems from the observation that combining these established\ntechniques with noise input can adversely affect model performance.\n  In this study, we propose a novel pretraining pipeline that learns to\ngenerate conditional noise mask specifically tailored to improve performance on\nmulti-modal and multi-organ datasets. As a reinforcement learning algorithm,\nour approach employs a dual-component system comprising a very light-weight\npolicy network that learns to sample conditional noise using a differentiable\nbeta distribution as well as a classifier network.

While collaborative efforts\nhave established conceptual foundations for such a framework, there remains a\nsignificant gap in developing concrete, technically robust methods for\nassessing AI model quality and performance. A critical drawback in the\ntraditional methods for assessing the validity and generalizability of models\nis their dependence on internal developer datasets, rendering it challenging to\nindependently assess and verify their performance claims. This paper introduces\na novel approach for assessing a newly trained model's performance based on\nanother known model by calculating correlation between neural networks. The\nproposed method evaluates correlations by determining if, for each neuron in\none network, there exists a neuron in the other network that produces similar\noutput. This approach has implications for memory efficiency, allowing for the\nuse of smaller networks when high correlation exists between networks of\ndifferent sizes. Additionally, the method provides insights into robustness,\nsuggesting that if two highly correlated networks are compared and one\ndemonstrates robustness when operating in production environments, the other is\nlikely to exhibit similar robustness.

In this paper, we introduce conformal depression\nprediction (CDP), a depression prediction method with uncertainty\nquantification based on conformal prediction (CP), giving valid confidence\nintervals with theoretical coverage guarantees for the model predictions. CDP\nis a plug-and-play module that requires neither model retraining nor an\nassumption about the depression data distribution.

However, it is perhaps more\ncommon than not for jailbreak developers to substantially exaggerate the\neffectiveness of their jailbreaks. We suggest this problem arises because\njailbreak researchers lack a standard, high-quality benchmark for evaluating\njailbreak performance, leaving researchers to create their own. To create a\nbenchmark, researchers must choose a dataset of forbidden prompts to which a\nvictim model will respond, along with an evaluation method that scores the\nharmfulness of the victim model's responses. We show that existing benchmarks\nsuffer from significant shortcomings and introduce the StrongREJECT benchmark\nto address these issues. StrongREJECT's dataset contains prompts that victim\nmodels must answer with specific, harmful information, while its automated\nevaluator measures the extent to which a response gives useful information to\nforbidden prompts. In doing so, the StrongREJECT evaluator achieves\nstate-of-the-art agreement with human judgments of jailbreak effectiveness.\nNotably, we find that existing evaluation methods significantly overstate\njailbreak effectiveness compared to human judgments and the StrongREJECT\nevaluator. We describe a surprising and novel phenomenon that explains this\ndiscrepancy: jailbreaks bypassing a victim model's safety fine-tuning tend to\nreduce its capabilities.

In the lottery ticket hypothesis, the iterative rewind\npruning (IRP) finds subnetworks retroactively by rewinding the parameter to the\noriginal initialization in every pruning iteration, which means all the\nsubnetworks are based on the initial state. Here, we hypothesise the surviving\nsubnetworks are more important and bridge the initial feature and their\nsurviving score as the PaI criterion.

They can be interpreted as\nlearning the gradients of a time-varying sequence of log-probability density\nfunctions. This interpretation has motivated classifier-based and\nclassifier-free guidance as methods for post-hoc control of diffusion models.\nIn this work, we build upon these ideas using the score-based interpretation of\ndiffusion models, and explore alternative ways to condition, modify, and reuse\ndiffusion models for tasks involving compositional generation and guidance. In\nparticular, we investigate why certain types of composition fail using current\ntechniques and present a number of solutions. We conclude that the sampler (not\nthe model) is responsible for this failure and propose new samplers, inspired\nby MCMC, which enable successful compositional generation.

We propose an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for\nearly cardiorespiratory disease screening, incorporating a preprocessing step\nsegmenting the data into individual breathing cycles, and a recurrent\nbidirectional module capturing features from diverse body regions. We employed\nLeave-one-out-cross-validation with Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter\ntuning and model selection. The experimental results consistently demonstrated\nthe superior performance of a bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) as\na feature encoder architecture, yielding an average sensitivity of $0.81 \\pm\n0.02$, specificity of $0.82 \\pm 0.05$, F1 score of $0.81 \\pm 0.02$, and\naccuracy of $80.2\\% \\pm 3.9$ across diverse seed variations.

In\nthis paper, we rethink this issue and propose a new task: 3D Data-Efficient\nPoint-Language Understanding. The goal is to enable LLMs to achieve robust 3D\nobject understanding with minimal 3D point cloud and text data pairs. To\naddress this task, we introduce GreenPLM, which leverages more text data to\ncompensate for the lack of 3D data. First, inspired by using CLIP to align\nimages and text, we utilize a pre-trained point cloud-text encoder to map the\n3D point cloud space to the text space. This mapping leaves us to seamlessly\nconnect the text space with LLMs. Once the point-text-LLM connection is\nestablished, we further enhance text-LLM alignment by expanding the\nintermediate text space, thereby reducing the reliance on 3D point cloud data.\nSpecifically, we generate 6M free-text descriptions of 3D objects, and design a\nthree-stage training strategy to help LLMs better explore the intrinsic\nconnections between different modalities. To achieve efficient modality\nalignment, we design a zero-parameter cross-attention module for token pooling.\nExtensive experimental results show that GreenPLM requires only 12% of the 3D\ntraining data used by existing state-of-the-art models to achieve superior 3D\nunderstanding. Remarkably, GreenPLM also achieves competitive performance using\ntext-only data.

To avoid huge cost brought by manual\npreparation of instruction datasets and training resources up to hundreds of\nhours, the exploitation of open knowledge including a wealth of low rank\nadaptation (LoRA) models and instruction datasets serves as a good starting\npoint. However, existing methods on model and data selection focus on the\nperformance of general-purpose capabilities while neglecting the knowledge gap\nexposed in domain-specific deployment.

For the former, we ensure that\nmodels that truly possess problem-solving abilities on K-shot are selected\nrather than those blind guessers.

Under this framework, we demonstrate\nthat when the pretraining dataset is sufficiently large, the estimator formed\nby CoT prompting is equivalent to a Bayesian estimator. This estimator\neffectively solves the multi-step reasoning problem by aggregating a posterior\ndistribution inferred from the demonstration examples in the prompt. Moreover,\nwe prove that the statistical error of the CoT estimator can be decomposed into\ntwo main components: (i) a prompting error, which arises from inferring the\ntrue task using CoT prompts, and (ii) the statistical error of the pretrained\nLLM. We establish that, under appropriate assumptions, the prompting error\ndecays exponentially to zero as the number of demonstrations increases.\nAdditionally, we explicitly characterize the approximation and generalization\nerrors of the pretrained LLM. Notably, we construct a transformer model that\napproximates the target distribution of the multi-step reasoning problem with\nan error that decreases exponentially in the number of transformer blocks.

Stability of Personal Values Expressed in Large\n  Language Models","summary":"  The standard way to study Large Language Models (LLMs) with benchmarks or\npsychology questionnaires is to provide many different queries from similar\nminimal contexts (e.g. multiple choice questions). However, due to LLMs' highly\ncontext-dependent nature, conclusions from such minimal-context evaluations may\nbe little informative about the model's behavior in deployment (where it will\nbe exposed to many new contexts). We argue that context-dependence\n(specifically, value stability) should be studied as a specific property of\nLLMs and used as another dimension of LLM comparison (alongside others such as\ncognitive abilities, knowledge, or model size). We present a case-study on the\nstability of value expression over different contexts (simulated conversations\non different topics) as measured using a standard psychology questionnaire\n(PVQ) and on behavioral downstream tasks. Reusing methods from psychology, we\nstudy Rank-order stability on the population (interpersonal) level, and\nIpsative stability on the individual (intrapersonal) level.

The consistency\nof these trends implies that some models exhibit higher value stability than\nothers, and that stability can be estimated with the set of introduced\nmethodological tools.

The goal is to enable LLMs to achieve robust 3D\nobject understanding with minimal 3D point cloud and text data pairs. To\naddress this task, we introduce GreenPLM, which leverages more text data to\ncompensate for the lack of 3D data. First, inspired by using CLIP to align\nimages and text, we utilize a pre-trained point cloud-text encoder to map the\n3D point cloud space to the text space. This mapping leaves us to seamlessly\nconnect the text space with LLMs. Once the point-text-LLM connection is\nestablished, we further enhance text-LLM alignment by expanding the\nintermediate text space, thereby reducing the reliance on 3D point cloud data.\nSpecifically, we generate 6M free-text descriptions of 3D objects, and design a\nthree-stage training strategy to help LLMs better explore the intrinsic\nconnections between different modalities.

A wide variety of\nmethods, using either spatially-based approaches or transform-based strategies,\nhave been developed and have shown to provide outstanding results. However,\nrecent advances in deep learning techniques and their application to SAR image\ndespeckling have been demonstrated to offer state-of-the-art results.\nUnfortunately, they have been mostly applied to single-polarimetric images. The\nextension of a deep learning-based approach for speckle removal to polarimetric\nSAR (PolSAR) images is complicated because of the complex nature of the\nmeasured covariance matrices for every image pixel, the properties of which\nmust be preserved during filtering. In this work, we propose a complete\nframework to remove speckle in polarimetric SAR images using a convolutional\nneural network. The methodology includes a reversible transformation of the\noriginal complex covariance matrix to obtain a set of real-valued intensity\nbands which are fed to the neural network. In addition, the proposed method\nincludes a change detection strategy to avoid the neural network to learn\nerroneous features in areas strongly affected by temporal changes, so that the\nnetwork only learns the underlying speckle component present in the data. The\nmethod is implemented and tested with dual-polarimetric images acquired by\nSentinel-1.

Transformer-based models excel in imaging\ntranslation tasks thanks to their ability to capture long-range dependencies.\nAlthough effective in supervised training settings, their performance falters\nin unpaired image synthesis, particularly in synthesizing structural details.\nThis paper empirically demonstrates that, lacking strong inductive biases,\nTransformer can converge to non-optimal solutions in the absence of paired\ndata.

In this paper, we\npropose an efficient heterogeneous spatial feature interaction method, termed\nDrone Referring Localization (DRL), which aims to localize UAV-view images\nwithin satellite imagery. Unlike conventional methods that treat different data\nsources in isolation, followed by cosine similarity computations, DRL\nfacilitates the learnable interaction of heterogeneous features.

However, in indoor scenes, the\ndensity computed from the SDF for a sampled point may not consistently reflect\nits real importance in volume rendering, often due to the influence of\nneighboring objects. To tackle this issue, our work proposes a novel approach\nfor indoor scene reconstruction, which instead parameterizes the density\nfunction with the Signed Ray Distance Function (SRDF). Firstly, the SRDF is\npredicted by the network and transformed to a ray-conditioned density function\nfor volume rendering. We argue that the ray-specific SRDF only considers the\nsurface along the camera ray, from which the derived density function is more\nconsistent to the real occupancy than that from the SDF. Secondly, although\nSRDF and SDF represent different aspects of scene geometries, their values\nshould share the same sign indicating the underlying spatial occupancy.\nTherefore, this work introduces a SRDF-SDF consistency loss to constrain the\nsigns of the SRDF and SDF outputs. Thirdly, this work proposes a\nself-supervised visibility task, introducing the physical visibility geometry\nto the reconstruction task. The visibility task combines prior from predicted\nSRDF and SDF as pseudo labels, and contributes to generating more accurate 3D\ngeometry.

The resulting images frequently exhibit issues\nsuch as incorrect numbers of fingers, unnatural twisting or interlacing of\nfingers, or blurred and indistinct hands. These issues stem from the inherent\ncomplexity of hand structures and the difficulty in aligning textual\ndescriptions with precise visual depictions of hands. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel approach named Hand1000 that enables the\ngeneration of realistic hand images with target gesture using only 1,000\ntraining samples. The training of Hand1000 is divided into three stages with\nthe first stage aiming to enhance the model's understanding of hand anatomy by\nusing a pre-trained hand gesture recognition model to extract gesture\nrepresentation. The second stage further optimizes text embedding by\nincorporating the extracted hand gesture representation, to improve alignment\nbetween the textual descriptions and the generated hand images. The third stage\nutilizes the optimized embedding to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model to\ngenerate realistic hand images. In addition, we construct the first publicly\navailable dataset specifically designed for text-to-hand image generation.\nBased on the existing hand gesture recognition dataset, we adopt advanced image\ncaptioning models and LLaMA3 to generate high-quality textual descriptions\nenriched with detailed gesture information.

They have ultra-high sensitivity -- down to individual photons -- and\ncan record photon arrival times with extremely high (sub-nanosecond)\nresolution. Single-photon 3D cameras estimate the round-trip time of a laser\npulse by forming equi-width (EW) histograms of detected photon timestamps.\nAcquiring and transferring such EW histograms requires high bandwidth and\nin-pixel memory, making SPCs less attractive in resource-constrained settings\nsuch as mobile devices and AR/VR headsets. In this work we propose a 3D sensing\ntechnique based on equi-depth (ED) histograms. ED histograms compress timestamp\ndata more efficiently than EW histograms, reducing the bandwidth requirement.\nMoreover, to reduce the in-pixel memory requirement, we propose a lightweight\nalgorithm to estimate ED histograms in an online fashion without explicitly\nstoring the photon timestamps. This algorithm is amenable to future in-pixel\nimplementations. We propose algorithms that process ED histograms to perform 3D\ncomputer-vision tasks of estimating scene distance maps and performing visual\nodometry under challenging conditions such as high ambient light.

To address this\nissue, in this work we propose to predict instance segmentations for 3D scenes\nin an unsupervised way, without relying on ground-truth annotations. To this\nend, we construct a learning framework consisting of two components: (1) a\npseudo-annotation scheme for generating initial unsupervised pseudo-labels; and\n(2) a self-training algorithm for instance segmentation to fit robust, accurate\ninstances from initial noisy proposals.

Built on the DUSt3R paradigm, Spann3R uses a\ntransformer-based architecture to directly regress pointmaps from images\nwithout any prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike DUSt3R,\nwhich predicts per image-pair pointmaps each expressed in its local coordinate\nframe, Spann3R can predict per-image pointmaps expressed in a global coordinate\nsystem, thus eliminating the need for optimization-based global alignment. The\nkey idea of Spann3R is to manage an external spatial memory that learns to keep\ntrack of all previous relevant 3D information. Spann3R then queries this\nspatial memory to predict the 3D structure of the next frame in a global\ncoordinate system. Taking advantage of DUSt3R's pre-trained weights, and\nfurther fine-tuning on a subset of datasets, Spann3R shows competitive\nperformance and generalization ability on various unseen datasets and can\nprocess ordered image collections in real time.

Mamba provides a near-linear alternative but is reported less effective\nin time series longterm forecasting due to potential information loss. Current\narchitectures fall short in offering both high efficiency and strong\nperformance for long-term dependency modeling.

However, most related\nstudies assume an ideal case where the number of users and their utility\ndemands, e.g., data rate constraints, are fixed, and the designed DL-based RA\nscheme exploits a policy trained only for these fixed parameters. Consequently,\ncomputationally complex policy retraining is required whenever these parameters\nchange. In this paper, we introduce a DL-based resource allocator (ALCOR) that\nallows users to adjust their utility demands freely, such as based on their\napplication layer requirements. ALCOR employs deep neural networks (DNNs) as\nthe policy in a time-sharing problem. The underlying optimization algorithm\niteratively optimizes the on-off status of users to satisfy their utility\ndemands in expectation. The policy performs unconstrained RA (URA)--RA without\nconsidering user utility demands--among active users to maximize the sum\nutility (SU) at each time instant. Depending on the chosen URA scheme, ALCOR\ncan perform RA in either a centralized or distributed scenario. Derived\nconvergence analyses provide guarantees for ALCOR's convergence, and numerical\nexperiments corroborate its effectiveness.\n","authors":["Pourya Behmandpoor","Mark Eisen","Panagiotis Patrinos","Marc Moonen"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04600v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15874v1","updated":"2024-08-28T15:44:34Z","published":"2024-08-28T15:44:34Z","title":"Robust Statistical Scaling of Outlier Scores: Improving the Quality of\n  Outlier Probabilities for Outliers (Extended Version)","summary":"  Outlier detection algorithms typically assign an outlier score to each\nobservation in a dataset, indicating the degree to which an observation is an\noutlier. However, these scores are often not comparable across algorithms and\ncan be difficult for humans to interpret. Statistical scaling addresses this\nproblem by transforming outlier scores into outlier probabilities without using\nground-truth labels, thereby improving interpretability and comparability\nacross algorithms. However, the quality of this transformation can be different\nfor outliers and inliers. Missing outliers in scenarios where they are of\nparticular interest - such as healthcare, finance, or engineering - can be\ncostly or dangerous. Thus, ensuring good probabilities for outliers is\nessential. This paper argues that statistical scaling, as commonly used in the\nliterature, does not produce equally good probabilities for outliers as for\ninliers. Therefore, we propose robust statistical scaling, which uses robust\nestimators to improve the probabilities for outliers. We evaluate several\nvariants of our method against other outlier score transformations for\nreal-world datasets and outlier detection algorithms, where it can improve the\nprobabilities for outliers.\n","authors":["Philipp Röchner","Henrique O.

Although numerous effective defense techniques have been proposed in\nrecent years, they inevitably rely on the availability of either clean or\npoisoned data. In contrast, data-free defense techniques have evolved slowly\nand still lag significantly in performance. To address this issue, different\nfrom the traditional approach of pruning followed by fine-tuning, we propose a\nnovel data-free defense method named Optimal Transport-based Backdoor Repairing\n(OTBR) in this work. This method, based on our findings on neuron weight\nchanges (NWCs) of random unlearning, uses optimal transport (OT)-based model\nfusion to combine the advantages of both pruned and backdoored models.\nSpecifically, we first demonstrate our findings that the NWCs of random\nunlearning are positively correlated with those of poison unlearning. Based on\nthis observation, we propose a random-unlearning NWC pruning technique to\neliminate the backdoor effect and obtain a backdoor-free pruned model. Then,\nmotivated by the OT-based model fusion, we propose the pruned-to-backdoored\nOT-based fusion technique, which fuses pruned and backdoored models to combine\nthe advantages of both, resulting in a model that demonstrates high clean\naccuracy and a low attack success rate. To our knowledge, this is the first\nwork to apply OT and model fusion techniques to backdoor defense.

In this work, we analyze CoT prompting from a\nstatistical estimation perspective, providing a comprehensive characterization\nof its sample complexity. To this end, we introduce a multi-step latent\nvariable model that encapsulates the reasoning process, where the latent\nvariable encodes the task information. Under this framework, we demonstrate\nthat when the pretraining dataset is sufficiently large, the estimator formed\nby CoT prompting is equivalent to a Bayesian estimator. This estimator\neffectively solves the multi-step reasoning problem by aggregating a posterior\ndistribution inferred from the demonstration examples in the prompt. Moreover,\nwe prove that the statistical error of the CoT estimator can be decomposed into\ntwo main components: (i) a prompting error, which arises from inferring the\ntrue task using CoT prompts, and (ii) the statistical error of the pretrained\nLLM. We establish that, under appropriate assumptions, the prompting error\ndecays exponentially to zero as the number of demonstrations increases.\nAdditionally, we explicitly characterize the approximation and generalization\nerrors of the pretrained LLM. Notably, we construct a transformer model that\napproximates the target distribution of the multi-step reasoning problem with\nan error that decreases exponentially in the number of transformer blocks.

As a\nperformance evaluation metric capable of considering the effects of process\nparameters, this paper uses a modified probability of detection (POD) approach\nto assess the reliability of ML-based algorithms. As an example, the POD-based\napproach is employed to assess ML models used for predicting the lane changing\nbehavior of a vehicle driver.

In motion planning, diverse configurations\nwere required in case a feasible trajectory was not found.

This means the classical IK solver and CC algorithm\nshould be executed repeatedly for every configuration. Thus, the preparation\ntime is long when the required number of goal configurations is large, e.g.\nmotion planning in cluster environments. Moreover, structured maps, which might\nbe difficult to obtain, were required by classical collision-checking\nalgorithms.

One key\naspect is that by increasing the number of families of operators used in\npretraining, a PDE foundation model can be fine-tuned to downstream tasks\ninvolving new PDEs with a limited number of samples, thus outperforming single\noperator neural networks. Specifically, a multi-operator learning model\npre-trained with data from diverse PDE families can predict unseen operators\nafter fine-tuning with only a limited number of operators from the new family,\nenabling them to serve as a data-free PDE solver. We also show that the\nproposed training and fine-tuning method is able to predict new operators in\nzero-shot prediction without samples. Additionally, we introduce a PDE-agnostic\nmeta-learning algorithm to improve the adaptability of the model to various\nPDEs by providing a better parameter initialization process. To address the\nneeds of applications with limited computing resources, we explore low-rank\nadaptation methods that reduce computational costs while enhancing solver\naccuracy. Lastly, by examining the scaling law with respect to the number of\noperator families, we establish and highlight its potential for broad\nadaptation in PDE-solving tasks.\n","authors":["Jingmin Sun","Zecheng Zhang","Hayden Schaeffer"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16168v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16167v1","updated":"2024-08-28T23:15:46Z","published":"2024-08-28T23:15:46Z","title":"Free Lunch in the Forest: Functionally-Identical Pruning of Boosted Tree\n  Ensembles","summary":"  Tree ensembles, including boosting methods, are highly effective and widely\nused for tabular data.

As generative models\nbecome widespread, data they generate is incorporated into shared content\nthrough the public web. This opens the question of what happens when data\ngenerated by a model is fed back to the model in subsequent training campaigns.\nThis is a question about the stability of the training process, whether the\ndistribution of publicly accessible content, which we refer to as \"knowledge\",\nremains stable or collapses.\n  Small scale empirical experiments reported in the literature show that this\nclosed-loop training process is prone to degenerating. Models may start\nproducing gibberish data, or sample from only a small subset of the desired\ndata distribution (a phenomenon referred to as mode collapse). So far there has\nbeen only limited theoretical understanding of this process, in part due to the\ncomplexity of the deep networks underlying these generative models.\n  The aim of this paper is to provide insights into this process (that we refer\nto as \"generative closed-loop learning\") by studying the learning dynamics of\ngenerative models that are fed back their own produced content in addition to\ntheir original training dataset. The sampling of many of these models can be\ncontrolled via a \"temperature\" parameter. Using dynamical systems tools, we\nshow that, unless a sufficient amount of external data is introduced at each\niteration, any non-trivial temperature leads the model to asymptotically\ndegenerate.

Such systems\nare essential in scientific computations. For example, any discretization of a\ncontinuum elastic rod can be viewed as interacting elements that can move and\nrotate in space, with each discrete element moving on the group of rotations\nand translations $SE(3)$.\n  We develop a novel method of data-based computation and complete phase space\nlearning of such systems.

This paper bridges this gap by profiling how DP\ngenerative models for tabular data distribute privacy budgets across rows and\ncolumns, which is one of the primary sources of utility degradation. We compare\ngraphical and deep generative models, focusing on the key factors contributing\nto how privacy budgets are spent, i.e., underlying modeling techniques, DP\nmechanisms, and data dimensionality.\n  Through our measurement study, we shed light on the characteristics that make\ndifferent models suitable for various settings and tasks.

Deep generative models spend their budgets\nper iteration, so their behavior is less predictable with varying dataset\ndimensions, but are more flexible as they could perform better if trained on\nmore features.

Keeping the trade-off between LLM\ncompatibility and structure complexity in mind, we design various graph\nreasoning tasks as a proxy to semi-structured tasks in this paper, in order to\ntest the ability to navigate through representations beyond plain text in\nvarious LLMs. Particularly, we design 10 distinct problems of graph traversal,\neach representing increasing levels of complexity, and benchmark 5 different\ninstruct-finetuned LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude-2, Llama-2 and Palm-2) on the\naforementioned tasks. Further, we analyse the performance of models across\nvarious settings such as varying sizes of graphs as well as different forms of\nk-shot prompting. We highlight various limitations, biases and properties of\nLLMs through this benchmarking process, such as an inverse relation to the\naverage degrees of freedom of traversal per node in graphs, the overall\nnegative impact of k-shot prompting on graph reasoning tasks, and a positive\nresponse bias which prevents LLMs from identifying the absence of a valid\nsolution. Finally, we introduce a new prompting technique specially designed\nfor graph traversal tasks (PathCompare), which demonstrates a notable increase\nin the performance of LLMs in comparison to standard prompting techniques such\nas Chain-of-Thought (CoT).\n","authors":["Palaash Agrawal","Shavak Vasania","Cheston Tan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01805v4.pdf","comment":"International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR), 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16542v1","updated":"2024-08-29T14:00:57Z","published":"2024-08-29T14:00:57Z","title":"SALSA: Speedy ASR-LLM Synchronous Aggregation","summary":"  Harnessing pre-trained LLMs to improve ASR systems, particularly for\nlow-resource languages, is now an emerging area of research.

To address these, studies prefixed with \"Self-\" such as\nSelf-Consistency, Self-Improve, and Self-Refine have been initiated. They share\na commonality: involving LLMs evaluating and updating themselves. Nonetheless,\nthese efforts lack a unified perspective on summarization, as existing surveys\npredominantly focus on categorization.\n  In this paper, we summarize a theoretical framework, Internal Consistency,\noffering explanations for reasoning deficiencies and hallucinations. Internal\nConsistency refers to the consistency in expressions among LLMs' latent,\ndecoding, or response layers based on sampling methodologies. Then, we\nintroduce another effective theoretical framework capable of mining Internal\nConsistency, named Self-Feedback. This framework consists of two modules:\nSelf-Evaluation and Self-Update. The former captures Internal Consistency\nSignals, while the latter leverages the signals to enhance either the model's\nresponse or the model itself. This framework has been employed in numerous\nstudies.\n  We systematically classify these studies by tasks and lines of work;\nsummarize relevant evaluation methods and benchmarks; and delve into the\nconcern, \"Does Self-Feedback Really Work?\" We also propose several critical\nviewpoints, including the \"Hourglass Evolution of Internal Consistency\",\n\"Consistency Is (Almost) Correctness\" hypothesis, and \"The Paradox of Latent\nand Explicit Reasoning\".

This is challenging, because the hands\nand body need to look natural w.r.t. each other, the grasped object, as well as\nthe local scene (i.e., a receptacle supporting the object). Only recent work\ntackles this, with a divide-and-conquer approach; it first generates a\n\"guiding\" right-hand grasp, and then searches for bodies that match this.\nHowever, the guiding-hand synthesis lacks controllability and receptacle\nawareness, so it likely has an implausible direction (i.e., a body can't match\nthis without penetrating the receptacle) and needs corrections through major\npost-processing. Moreover, the body search needs exhaustive sampling and is\nexpensive. These are strong limitations. We tackle these with a novel method\ncalled CWGrasp. Our key idea is that performing geometry-based reasoning \"early\non,\" instead of \"too late,\" provides rich \"control\" signals for inference. To\nthis end, CWGrasp first samples a plausible reaching-direction vector (used\nlater for both the arm and hand) from a probabilistic model built via\nraycasting from the object and collision checking.

However, recent studies\nhave highlighted the susceptibility of these Med-VLMs to adversarial attacks,\nraising concerns about their safety and robustness. Randomized smoothing is a\nwell-known technique for turning any classifier into a model that is\ncertifiably robust to adversarial perturbations. However, this approach\nrequires retraining the Med-VLM-based classifier so that it classifies well\nunder Gaussian noise, which is often infeasible in practice. In this paper, we\npropose a novel framework called PromptSmooth to achieve efficient certified\nrobustness of Med-VLMs by leveraging the concept of prompt learning. Given any\npre-trained Med-VLM, PromptSmooth adapts it to handle Gaussian noise by\nlearning textual prompts in a zero-shot or few-shot manner, achieving a\ndelicate balance between accuracy and robustness, while minimizing the\ncomputational overhead. Moreover, PromptSmooth requires only a single model to\nhandle multiple noise levels, which substantially reduces the computational\ncost compared to traditional methods that rely on training a separate model for\neach noise level.

The key insight is to unleash the strong generative prior of\nlarge pre-trained video diffusion models for sparse-view reconstruction.\nHowever, 3D view consistency struggles to be accurately preserved in directly\ngenerated video frames from pre-trained models. To address this, given limited\ninput views, the proposed ReconX first constructs a global point cloud and\nencodes it into a contextual space as the 3D structure condition.

Although having a strong representation ability, the Vision\nTransformer (ViT) tends to overfit on most distinct regions of training data,\nlimiting its generalizability and attention to holistic object features.\nMeanwhile, due to the structural difference between CNN and ViT, fine-grained\nstrategies that effectively address this issue in CNN do not continue to be\nsuccessful in ViT. To address this issue, by observing the latent diverse\nrepresentation hidden behind the multi-head attention, we present PartFormer,\nan innovative adaptation of ViT designed to overcome the granularity\nlimitations in object Re-ID tasks. The PartFormer integrates a Head\nDisentangling Block (HDB) that awakens the diverse representation of multi-head\nself-attention without the typical loss of feature richness induced by\nconcatenation and FFN layers post-attention. To avoid the homogenization of\nattention heads and promote robust part-based feature learning, two head\ndiversity constraints are imposed: attention diversity constraint and\ncorrelation diversity constraint. These constraints enable the model to exploit\ndiverse and discriminative feature representations from different attention\nheads.

However, these networks\noften face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost. To address\nthis, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce\nthe dependency on annotations. This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised\nmethod called Eigen-cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations,\nachieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches. This method is\nbased on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level\nQuality Cluster Coefficient (QCC). The TEL ensures temporal coherence by\nleveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency\nmatrices. By minimizing the mean absolute error (MAE) between the eigenvalues\nof adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable\nsegmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and\nimproving overall segmentation quality. The QCC employs the K-means method to\nensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth\nmasks. Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure\nof feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to\nvarying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase.\nThese enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering\nsignificant performance gains without additional annotated data.

F1 scores were 0.968, 0.958, and 0.954 for 0$^{\\circ}$, 1$^{\\circ}$,\nand 2$^{\\circ}$, respectively, which is better than previously reported DL\napproaches. Our method minimizes the need for labelled data by only\nnecessitating a fraction of labelled cones, which is especially beneficial in\nthe field of ophthalmology, where labelled data can often be limited.\n","authors":["Mikhail Kulyabin","Aline Sindel","Hilde Pedersen","Stuart Gilson","Rigmor Baraas","Andreas Maier"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14810v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16563v1","updated":"2024-08-29T14:30:45Z","published":"2024-08-29T14:30:45Z","title":"MST-KD: Multiple Specialized Teachers Knowledge Distillation for Fair\n  Face Recognition","summary":"  As in school, one teacher to cover all subjects is insufficient to distill\nequally robust information to a student.

However, labeling such\nimages demands greater resources compared to pinhole images. As a result, many\nunsupervised domain adaptation methods for panoramic semantic segmentation have\nemerged, utilizing real pinhole images or low-cost synthetic panoramic images.\nBut, the segmentation model lacks understanding of the panoramic structure when\nonly utilizing real pinhole images, and it lacks perception of real-world\nscenes when only adopting synthetic panoramic images. Therefore, in this paper,\nwe propose a new task of multi-source domain adaptation for panoramic semantic\nsegmentation, aiming to utilize both real pinhole and synthetic panoramic\nimages in the source domains, enabling the segmentation model to perform well\non unlabeled real panoramic images in the target domain. Further, we propose\nDeformation Transform Aligner for Panoramic Semantic Segmentation (DTA4PASS),\nwhich converts all pinhole images in the source domains into panoramic-like\nimages, and then aligns the converted source domains with the target domain.\nSpecifically, DTA4PASS consists of two main components: Unpaired Semantic\nMorphing (USM) and Distortion Gating Alignment (DGA). Firstly, in USM, the\nSemantic Dual-view Discriminator (SDD) assists in training the diffeomorphic\ndeformation network, enabling the effective transformation of pinhole images\nwithout paired panoramic views. Secondly, DGA assigns pinhole-like and\npanoramic-like features to each image by gating, and aligns these two features\nthrough uncertainty estimation.

As a result, this\nmisalignment of audio and visual features could yield inferior performance. To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel audio-visual learning framework which is\ninstantiated with two individual learning schemes: self-supervised predictive\nlearning (SSPL) and semantic-aware contrastive learning (SACL). SSPL explores\nimage-audio positive pairs alone to discover semantically coherent similarities\nbetween audio and visual features, while a predictive coding module for feature\nalignment is introduced to facilitate the positive-only learning. In this\nregard SSPL acts as a negative-free method to eliminate false negatives. By\ncontrast, SACL is designed to compact visual features and remove false\nnegatives, providing reliable visual anchor and audio negatives for contrast.\nDifferent from SSPL, SACL releases the potential of audio-visual contrastive\nlearning, offering an effective alternative to achieve the same goal.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the\nstate-of-the-arts.

In this work, we propose a complete\nframework to remove speckle in polarimetric SAR images using a convolutional\nneural network. The methodology includes a reversible transformation of the\noriginal complex covariance matrix to obtain a set of real-valued intensity\nbands which are fed to the neural network. In addition, the proposed method\nincludes a change detection strategy to avoid the neural network to learn\nerroneous features in areas strongly affected by temporal changes, so that the\nnetwork only learns the underlying speckle component present in the data. The\nmethod is implemented and tested with dual-polarimetric images acquired by\nSentinel-1. Experiments show that the proposed approach offers exceptional\nresults in both speckle reduction and resolution preservation. More\nimportantly, it is also shown that the neural network is not generating\nartifacts or introducing bias in the filtered images, making them suitable for\nfurther polarimetric processing and exploitation.\n","authors":["Alejandro Mestre-Quereda","Juan M.

The presence of high-density\nmetallic implants results in artifacts that deteriorate image quality,\nmanifesting in the forms of streaking, blurring, or beam hardening effects,\netc. Nowadays, various deep learning-based approaches, particularly generative\nmodels, have been proposed for metal artifact reduction (MAR). However, these\nmethods have limited perception ability in the diverse morphologies of\ndifferent metal implants with artifacts, which may generate spurious anatomical\nstructures and exhibit inferior generalization capability. To address the\nissues, we leverage visual-language model (VLM) to identify these morphological\nfeatures and introduce them into a dual-domain CLIP-assisted residual\noptimization perception model (DuDoCROP) for MAR. Specifically, a dual-domain\nCLIP (DuDoCLIP) is fine-tuned on the image domain and sinogram domain using\ncontrastive learning to extract semantic descriptions from anatomical\nstructures and metal artifacts. Subsequently, a diffusion model is guided by\nthe embeddings of DuDoCLIP, thereby enabling the dual-domain prior generation.\nAdditionally, we design prompt engineering for more precise image-text\ndescriptions that can enhance the model's perception capability. Then, a\ndownstream task is devised for the one-step residual optimization and\nintegration of dual-domain priors, while incorporating raw data fidelity.\nUltimately, a new perceptual indicator is proposed to validate the model's\nperception and generation performance. With the assistance of DuDoCLIP, our\nDuDoCROP exhibits at least 63.7% higher generalization capability compared to\nthe baseline model.

The parallel structure allows for\npre-processing of the individual parts, which decreases the run-time. Using a\nzero-shot network allows for a very short set-up time, as it is not necessary\nto train models for new objects.

The combined\nuse of these technical contributions results in TiCoSS, a state-of-the-art\njoint learning framework that simultaneously tackles semantic segmentation and\nstereo matching.

However, 3D\npoint clouds have gained attention due to their robustness to environmental\nfactors and their ability to represent geometric data. Existing 3D anomaly\ndetection methods generally fall into two categories. One compares scanned 3D\npoint clouds with design files, assuming these files are always available.\nHowever, such assumptions are often violated in many real-world applications\nwhere model-free products exist, such as fresh produce (i.e., ``Cookie\",\n``Potato\", etc.), dentures, bone, etc. The other category compares patches of\nscanned 3D point clouds with a library of normal patches named memory bank.\nHowever, those methods usually fail to detect incomplete shapes, which is a\nfairly common defect type (i.e., missing pieces of different products). The\nmain challenge is that missing areas in 3D point clouds represent the absence\nof scanned points. This makes it infeasible to compare the missing region with\nexisting point cloud patches in the memory bank. To address these two\nchallenges, we proposed a unified, unsupervised 3D anomaly detection framework\ncapable of identifying all types of defects on model-free products. Our method\nintegrates two detection modules: a feature-based detection module and a\nreconstruction-based detection module. Feature-based detection covers geometric\ndefects, such as dents, holes, and cracks, while the reconstruction-based\nmethod detects missing regions. Additionally, we employ a One-class Support\nVector Machine (OCSVM) to fuse the detection results from both modules.

In this paper we address, the challenge of local image\nmanipulation in DMs and introduce an unsupervised method to factorize the\nlatent semantics learned by the denoising network of pre-trained DMs. Given an\narbitrary image and defined regions of interest, we utilize the Jacobian of the\ndenoising network to establish a relation between the regions of interest and\ntheir corresponding subspaces in the latent space. Furthermore, we disentangle\nthe joint and individual components of these subspaces to identify latent\ndirections that enable local image manipulation. Once discovered, these\ndirections can be applied to different images to produce semantically\nconsistent edits, making our method suitable for practical applications.\nExperimental results on various datasets demonstrate that our method can\nproduce semantic edits that are more localized and have better fidelity\ncompared to the state-of-the-art.\n","authors":["Theodoros Kouzelis","Manos Plitsis","Mihalis A.

This approach, however, is known to limit descriptiveness and\nsemantic richness and tends to drive the model towards the style of\nground-truth sentences, thus losing detail and specificity. On the contrary,\nrecent attempts to employ image-text models like CLIP as reward have led to\ngrammatically incorrect and repetitive captions. In this paper, we propose\nSelf-Cap, a captioning approach that relies on a learnable reward model based\non self-generated negatives that can discriminate captions based on their\nconsistency with the image. Specifically, our discriminator is a fine-tuned\ncontrastive image-text model trained to promote caption correctness while\navoiding the aberrations that typically happen when training with a CLIP-based\nreward. To this end, our discriminator directly incorporates negative samples\nfrom a frozen captioner, which significantly improves the quality and richness\nof the generated captions but also reduces the fine-tuning time in comparison\nto using the CIDEr score as the sole metric for optimization.

Concretely, traffic related to the\nadvertisement is considerably sparser compared to that of natural content,\nwhich motivates the development of transferring knowledge from the richer\nsource natural content domain to the sparser advertising domain. The challenges\ninclude the inefficiencies arising from the management of extensive source data\nand the problem of 'catastrophic forgetting' that results from the CTR model's\ndaily updating. To this end, we propose a novel tri-level asynchronous\nframework, i.e., Efficient Transfer Learning Framework for Cross-Domain\nClick-Through Rate Prediction (E-CDCTR), to transfer comprehensive knowledge of\nnatural content to advertisement CTR models.

This paper presents a novel catalog of\npractices for addressing fairness in machine learning derived from a systematic\nmapping study. The study identifies and categorizes 28 practices from existing\nliterature, mapping them onto different stages of the machine learning\nlifecycle.

The majority of GNNs follow the message-passing paradigm, where\nrepresentations of each node are learned by recursively aggregating features of\nits neighbors. However, this mechanism brings severe over-smoothing and\nefficiency issues over high-degree graphs (HDGs), wherein most nodes have\ndozens (or even hundreds) of neighbors, such as social networks, transaction\ngraphs, power grids, etc. Additionally, such graphs usually encompass rich and\ncomplex structure semantics, which are hard to capture merely by feature\naggregations in GNNs. Motivated by the above limitations, we propose TADA, an\nefficient and effective front-mounted data augmentation framework for GNNs on\nHDGs. Under the hood, TADA includes two key modules: (i) feature expansion with\nstructure embeddings, and (ii) topology- and attribute-aware graph\nsparsification.

This hybrid approach is known as a variational mode graph convolutional\nnetwork (VMGCN). Instead of exhaustively searching for the number of modes,\nthey are determined using the reconstruction loss from the real-time\napplication data. We also study the significance of each mode and the impact of\nbandwidth constraints on different horizon predictions in traffic flow data. We\nevaluate the performance of our proposed network on the LargeST dataset for\nboth short and long-term predictions.

Spiking\nneural networks (SNNs), which mimic the brain's information-processing\nmechanisms, are well-suited for emulating the human capability of AVSR. Despite\ntheir potential, research on SNNs for AVSR is scarce, with most existing\naudio-visual multimodal methods focused on object or digit recognition. These\nmodels simply integrate features from both modalities, neglecting their unique\ncharacteristics and interactions. Additionally, they often rely on future\ninformation for current processing, which increases recognition latency and\nlimits real-time applicability. Inspired by human speech perception, this paper\nproposes a novel human-inspired SNN named HI-AVSNN for AVSR, incorporating\nthree key characteristics: cueing interaction, causal processing and spike\nactivity. For cueing interaction, we propose a visual-cued auditory attention\nmodule (VCA2M) that leverages visual cues to guide attention to auditory\nfeatures. We achieve causal processing by aligning the SNN's temporal dimension\nwith that of visual and auditory features and applying temporal masking to\nutilize only past and current information. To implement spike activity, in\naddition to using SNNs, we leverage the event camera to capture lip movement as\nspikes, mimicking the human retina and providing efficient visual data. We\nevaluate HI-AVSNN on an audiovisual speech recognition dataset combining the\nDVS-Lip dataset with its corresponding audio samples. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the superiority of our proposed fusion method, outperforming\nexisting audio-visual SNN fusion methods and achieving a 2.27% improvement in\naccuracy over the only existing SNN-based AVSR method.\n","authors":["Qianhui Liu","Jiadong Wang","Yang Wang","Xin Yang","Gang Pan","Haizhou Li"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16564v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16532v1","updated":"2024-08-29T13:43:36Z","published":"2024-08-29T13:43:36Z","title":"WavTokenizer: an Efficient Acoustic Discrete Codec Tokenizer for Audio\n  Language Modeling","summary":"  Language models have been effectively applied to modeling natural signals,\nsuch as images, video, speech, and audio.

In this paper, we introduce WavTokenizer,\nwhich offers several advantages over previous SOTA acoustic codec models in the\naudio domain: 1)extreme compression. By compressing the layers of quantizers\nand the temporal dimension of the discrete codec, one-second audio of 24kHz\nsampling rate requires only a single quantizer with 40 or 75 tokens. 2)improved\nsubjective quality.

However, the process of Optical\nCharacter Recognition (OCR) used to convert physical records to digital text is\nprone to errors, particularly in the case of newspapers and periodicals due to\ntheir complex layouts. This paper introduces Context Leveraging OCR Correction\n(CLOCR-C), which utilises the infilling and context-adaptive abilities of\ntransformer-based language models (LMs) to improve OCR quality. The study aims\nto determine if LMs can perform post-OCR correction, improve downstream NLP\ntasks, and the value of providing the socio-cultural context as part of the\ncorrection process. Experiments were conducted using seven LMs on three\ndatasets: the 19th Century Serials Edition (NCSE) and two datasets from the\nOverproof collection. The results demonstrate that some LMs can significantly\nreduce error rates, with the top-performing model achieving over a 60%\nreduction in character error rate on the NCSE dataset. The OCR improvements\nextend to downstream tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition, with increased\nCosine Named Entity Similarity. Furthermore, the study shows that providing\nsocio-cultural context in the prompts improves performance, while misleading\nprompts lower performance.

Even in the era of\nlarge-scale language models (LLMs), MoE continues to play a crucial role, as\nsome researchers have indicated that GPT-4 adopts the MoE structure to ensure\ndiverse inference results. However, MoE is susceptible to performance\ndegeneracy, particularly evident in the issues of imbalance and homogeneous\nrepresentation among experts. While previous studies have extensively addressed\nthe problem of imbalance, the challenge of homogeneous representation remains\nunresolved. In this study, we shed light on the homogeneous representation\nproblem, wherein experts in the MoE fail to specialize and lack diversity,\nleading to frustratingly high similarities in their representations (up to 99\\%\nin a well-performed MoE model).

A major challenge in this domain is\ncatastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge upon\nlearning new tasks. Existing approaches commonly utilize multiple\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) blocks to acquire task-specific\nknowledge, yet these methods are inefficient and fail to leverage potential\nknowledge transfer across tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel CL\nframework for language models, named Task Skill Localization and Consolidation\n(TaSL), which boosts knowledge transfer without depending on memory replay.\nTaSL initially segregates the model into 'skill units' based on parameter\ndependencies, allowing for more precise control. Subsequently, it employs a\nnovel group-wise skill localization technique to ascertain the importance\ndistribution of skill units for a new task. By comparing this importance\ndistribution with those from previous tasks, we implement a fine-grained skill\nconsolidation strategy that retains task-specific knowledge, thereby preventing\nforgetting, and updates task-shared knowledge, which facilitates bi-directional\nknowledge transfer. As a result, TaSL achieves an optimal balance between\nretaining prior knowledge and excelling in new tasks. TaSL also demonstrates\nstrong generalizability, making it suitable for various base models and\nadaptable to PEFT methods like LoRA. Furthermore, it offers notable\nextensibility, supporting enhancements through integration with memory replay\ntechniques.

However,\nthese codecs were originally designed for audio compression, which may lead to\nsuboptimal performance in the context of audio LLM. Our research aims to\naddress the shortcomings of current audio LLM codecs, particularly their\nchallenges in maintaining semantic integrity in generated audio. For instance,\nexisting methods like VALL-E, which condition acoustic token generation on text\ntranscriptions, often suffer from content inaccuracies and elevated word error\nrates (WER) due to semantic misinterpretations of acoustic tokens, resulting in\nword skipping and errors.

Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they\nface challenges in scientific literature understanding, primarily due to (1) a\nlack of scientific knowledge and (2) unfamiliarity with specialized scientific\ntasks.\n  To develop an LLM specialized in scientific literature understanding, we\npropose a hybrid strategy that integrates continual pre-training (CPT) and\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT), to simultaneously infuse scientific domain\nknowledge and enhance instruction-following capabilities for domain-specific\ntasks.cIn this process, we identify two key challenges: (1) constructing\nhigh-quality CPT corpora, and (2) generating diverse SFT instructions. We\naddress these challenges through a meticulous pipeline, including PDF text\nextraction, parsing content error correction, quality filtering, and synthetic\ninstruction creation. Applying this strategy, we present a suite of LLMs:\nSciLitLLM, specialized in scientific literature understanding. These models\ndemonstrate promising performance on scientific literature understanding\nbenchmarks.\n  Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present an effective framework that\nintegrates CPT and SFT to adapt LLMs to scientific literature understanding,\nwhich can also be easily adapted to other domains. (2) We propose an LLM-based\nsynthesis method to generate diverse and high-quality scientific instructions,\nresulting in a new instruction set -- SciLitIns -- for supervised fine-tuning\nin less-represented scientific domains.

Fully fine-tuning on limited surgical data can cause\noverfitting and catastrophic forgetting, compromising model robustness and\ngeneralization. Although Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addresses some adaptation\nissues, its uniform parameter distribution neglects the inherent feature\nhierarchy, where earlier layers, learning more general features, require more\nparameters than later ones. To tackle this issue, we introduce Depth Anything\nin Robotic Endoscopic Surgery (DARES), a novel approach that employs a new\nadaptation technique, Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (Vector-LoRA) on the DAM V2 to\nperform self-supervised monocular depth estimation in RAS scenes.

While deep learning has excelled in\nautomating this task, a major hurdle is the need for numerous annotated\nsegmentation masks, which are resource-intensive to produce due to the required\nexpertise and time. This scenario often leads to ultra low-data regimes, where\nannotated images are extremely limited, posing significant challenges for the\ngeneralization of conventional deep learning methods on test images. To address\nthis, we introduce a generative deep learning framework, which uniquely\ngenerates high-quality paired segmentation masks and medical images, serving as\nauxiliary data for training robust models in data-scarce environments. Unlike\ntraditional generative models that treat data generation and segmentation model\ntraining as separate processes, our method employs multi-level optimization for\nend-to-end data generation. This approach allows segmentation performance to\ndirectly influence the data generation process, ensuring that the generated\ndata is specifically tailored to enhance the performance of the segmentation\nmodel. Our method demonstrated strong generalization performance across 9\ndiverse medical image segmentation tasks and on 16 datasets, in ultra-low data\nregimes, spanning various diseases, organs, and imaging modalities. When\napplied to various segmentation models, it achieved performance improvements of\n10-20\\% (absolute), in both same-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.

While remarkable\nprogress has been made for rigid object manipulation, manipulating deformable\nobjects poses unique challenges, including frequent occlusions,\ninfinite-dimensional state spaces and complex dynamics. Just as object pose\nestimation and tracking have aided robots for rigid manipulation, dense 3D\ntracking (scene flow) of highly deformable objects will enable new applications\nin robotics while aiding existing approaches, such as imitation learning or\ncreating digital twins with real2sim transfer. We propose DeformGS, an approach\nto recover scene flow in highly deformable scenes, using simultaneous video\ncaptures of a dynamic scene from multiple cameras. DeformGS builds on recent\nadvances in Gaussian splatting, a method that learns the properties of a large\nnumber of Gaussians for state-of-the-art and fast novel-view synthesis.\nDeformGS learns a deformation function to project a set of Gaussians with\ncanonical properties into world space. The deformation function uses a\nneural-voxel encoding and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to infer Gaussian\nposition, rotation, and a shadow scalar. We enforce physics-inspired\nregularization terms based on conservation of momentum and isometry, which\nleads to trajectories with smaller trajectory errors. We also leverage existing\nfoundation models SAM and XMEM to produce noisy masks, and learn a per-Gaussian\nmask for better physics-inspired regularization.

OOD\ndetection methods can be categorised as either confidence-based (using the\nmodel's output layer for OOD detection) or feature-based (not using the output\nlayer). We created two new OOD benchmarks by dividing the D7P (dermatology) and\nBreastMNIST (ultrasound) datasets into subsets which either contain or don't\ncontain an artefact (rulers or annotations respectively). Models were trained\nwith artefact-free images, and images with the artefacts were used as OOD test\nsets. For each OOD image, we created a counterfactual by manually removing the\nartefact via image processing, to assess the artefact's impact on the model's\npredictions. We show that OOD artefacts can boost a model's softmax confidence\nin its predictions, due to correlations in training data among other factors.\nThis contradicts the common assumption that OOD artefacts should lead to more\nuncertain outputs, an assumption on which most confidence-based methods rely.\nWe use this to explain why feature-based methods (e.g. Mahalanobis score)\ntypically have greater OOD detection performance than confidence-based methods\n(e.g. MCP).

However, they suffer from performance\ndegradation in adverse weather conditions due to the quality deterioration of\nLiDAR point clouds. Fusing LiDAR with the weather-robust 4D radar sensor is\nexpected to solve this problem. However, the fusion of LiDAR and 4D radar is\nchallenging because they differ significantly in terms of data quality and the\ndegree of degradation in adverse weather. To address these issues, we introduce\nL4DR, a weather-robust 3D object detection method that effectively achieves\nLiDAR and 4D Radar fusion. Our L4DR includes Multi-Modal Encoding (MME) and\nForeground-Aware Denoising (FAD) technique to reconcile sensor gaps, which is\nthe first exploration of the complementarity of early fusion between LiDAR and\n4D radar. Additionally, we design an Inter-Modal and Intra-Modal ({IM}2 )\nparallel feature extraction backbone coupled with a Multi-Scale Gated Fusion\n(MSGF) module to counteract the varying degrees of sensor degradation under\nadverse weather conditions. Experimental evaluation on a VoD dataset with\nsimulated fog proves that L4DR is more adaptable to changing weather\nconditions. It delivers a significant performance increase under different fog\nlevels, improving the 3D mAP by up to 20.0% over the traditional LiDAR-only\napproach. Moreover, the results on the K-Radar dataset validate the consistent\nperformance improvement of L4DR in real-world adverse weather conditions.\n","authors":["Xun Huang","Ziyu Xu","Hai Wu","Jinlong Wang","Qiming Xia","Yan Xia","Jonathan Li","Kyle Gao","Chenglu Wen","Cheng Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03677v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17297v1","updated":"2024-08-30T13:52:26Z","published":"2024-08-30T13:52:26Z","title":"BOP-D: Revisiting 6D Pose Estimation Benchmark for Better Evaluation\n  under Visual Ambiguities","summary":"  Currently, 6D pose estimation methods are benchmarked on datasets that\nconsider, for their ground truth annotations, visual ambiguities as only\nrelated to global object symmetries.

To this end,\nexisting mainstream solutions typically introduce additional perspective-based\n360 representations (\\textit{e.g.}, Cubemap) to achieve effective feature\nextraction. Nevertheless, regardless of the introduced representations, they\neventually need to be unified into the equirectangular projection (ERP) format\nfor the subsequent depth estimation, which inevitably reintroduces the\ntroublesome distortions.

It typically comprises an analysis transform, a synthesis transform,\nquantization and an entropy coding model. The analysis transform and synthesis\ntransform are used to encode an image to latent feature and decode the\nquantized feature to reconstruct the image, and can be regarded as coupled\ntransforms. However, the analysis transform and synthesis transform are\ndesigned independently in the existing methods, making them unreliable in\nhigh-quality image compression. Inspired by the invertible neural networks in\ngenerative modeling, invertible modules are used to construct the coupled\nanalysis and synthesis transforms. Considering the noise introduced in the\nfeature quantization invalidates the invertible process, this paper proposes an\nApproximately Invertible Neural Network (A-INN) framework for learned image\ncompression. It formulates the rate-distortion optimization in lossy image\ncompression when using INN with quantization, which differentiates from using\nINN for generative modelling. Generally speaking, A-INN can be used as the\ntheoretical foundation for any INN based lossy compression method. Based on\nthis formulation, A-INN with a progressive denoising module (PDM) is developed\nto effectively reduce the quantization noise in the decoding. Moreover, a\nCascaded Feature Recovery Module (CFRM) is designed to learn high-dimensional\nfeature recovery from low-dimensional ones to further reduce the noise in\nfeature channel compression. In addition, a Frequency-enhanced Decomposition\nand Synthesis Module (FDSM) is developed by explicitly enhancing the\nhigh-frequency components in an image to address the loss of high-frequency\ninformation inherent in neural network based image compression.

However, difficulties\nin obtaining annotations and huge variations in distribution between training\nsets and real scenes have limited their clinical applications. To address these\nlimitations, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been used to\ntransfer knowledge from one labeled source domain to the unlabeled target\ndomain, yet these approaches suffer from severe domain shift issues and often\nignore the potential benefits of leveraging multiple relevant sources in\npractical applications. To address these limitations, in this work, we\nconstruct a Three-Branch Mixed extractor and propose a Bi-level Multi-source\nunsupervised domain adaptation method called BTMuda for breast cancer\ndiagnosis. Our method addresses the problems of domain shift by dividing domain\nshift issues into two levels: intra-domain and inter-domain. To reduce the\nintra-domain shift, we jointly train a CNN and a Transformer as two paths of a\ndomain mixed feature extractor to obtain robust representations rich in both\nlow-level local and high-level global information. As for the inter-domain\nshift, we redesign the Transformer delicately to a three-branch architecture\nwith cross-attention and distillation, which learns domain-invariant\nrepresentations from multiple domains.

One effective solution to enhance this\nability is to train the models with manually-blended data, which we termed\n\"blendfake\", encouraging models to learn generic forgery artifacts like\nblending boundary. Interestingly, current SoTA methods utilize blendfake\nwithout incorporating any deepfake data in their training process. This is\nlikely because previous empirical observations suggest that vanilla hybrid\ntraining (VHT), which combines deepfake and blendfake data, results in inferior\nperformance to methods using only blendfake data (so-called \"1+1<2\").\nTherefore, a critical question arises: Can we leave deepfake behind and rely\nsolely on blendfake data to train an effective deepfake detector? Intuitively,\nas deepfakes also contain additional informative forgery clues (e.g., deep\ngenerative artifacts), excluding all deepfake data in training deepfake\ndetectors seems counter-intuitive. In this paper, we rethink the role of\nblendfake in detecting deepfakes and formulate the process from \"real to\nblendfake to deepfake\" to be a progressive transition. Specifically, blendfake\nand deepfake can be explicitly delineated as the oriented pivot anchors between\n\"real-to-fake\" transitions. The accumulation of forgery information should be\noriented and progressively increasing during this transition process. To this\nend, we propose an Oriented Progressive Regularizor (OPR) to establish the\nconstraints that compel the distribution of anchors to be discretely arranged.\nFurthermore, we introduce feature bridging to facilitate the smooth transition\nbetween adjacent anchors.

However, its effects on learned policies remain\npuzzling: some studies highlight its importance for achieving strong\nperformance, while others observe detrimental effects. In this paper, we first\ndissect the role of action chunking by analyzing the divergence between the\nlearner and the demonstrator. We find that longer action chunks enable a policy\nto better capture temporal dependencies by taking into account more past states\nand actions within the chunk. However, this advantage comes at the cost of\nexacerbating errors in stochastic environments due to fewer observations of\nrecent states. To address this, we propose Bidirectional Decoding (BID), a\ntest-time inference algorithm that bridges action chunking with closed-loop\noperations. BID samples multiple predictions at each time step and searches for\nthe optimal one based on two criteria: (i) backward coherence, which favors\nsamples aligned with previous decisions, (ii) forward contrast, which favors\nsamples close to outputs of a stronger policy and distant from those of a\nweaker policy. By coupling decisions within and across action chunks, BID\nenhances temporal consistency over extended sequences while enabling adaptive\nreplanning in stochastic environments.

OOD\ndetection methods can be categorised as either confidence-based (using the\nmodel's output layer for OOD detection) or feature-based (not using the output\nlayer). We created two new OOD benchmarks by dividing the D7P (dermatology) and\nBreastMNIST (ultrasound) datasets into subsets which either contain or don't\ncontain an artefact (rulers or annotations respectively). Models were trained\nwith artefact-free images, and images with the artefacts were used as OOD test\nsets. For each OOD image, we created a counterfactual by manually removing the\nartefact via image processing, to assess the artefact's impact on the model's\npredictions. We show that OOD artefacts can boost a model's softmax confidence\nin its predictions, due to correlations in training data among other factors.\nThis contradicts the common assumption that OOD artefacts should lead to more\nuncertain outputs, an assumption on which most confidence-based methods rely.\nWe use this to explain why feature-based methods (e.g. Mahalanobis score)\ntypically have greater OOD detection performance than confidence-based methods\n(e.g. MCP).

The strong\ntemperature dependence of the rheology of mantle rocks causes viscosity\nvariations of several orders of magnitude, leading to a slow-evolving stagnant\nlid where heat conduction dominates, overlying a rapidly-evolving and strongly\nconvecting region. Time-stepping methods, while effective for fluids with\nconstant viscosity, are hindered by the Courant criterion, which restricts the\ntime step based on the system's maximum velocity and grid size. Consequently,\nachieving steady-state requires a large number of time steps due to the\ndisparate time scales governing the stagnant and convecting regions.\n  We present a concept for accelerating mantle convection simulations using\nmachine learning. We generate a dataset of 128 two-dimensional simulations with\nmixed basal and internal heating, and pressure- and temperature-dependent\nviscosity. We train a feedforward neural network on 97 simulations to predict\nsteady-state temperature profiles. These can then be used to initialize\nnumerical time stepping methods for different simulation parameters.

However, these scores are often not comparable across algorithms and\ncan be difficult for humans to interpret. Statistical scaling addresses this\nproblem by transforming outlier scores into outlier probabilities without using\nground-truth labels, thereby improving interpretability and comparability\nacross algorithms. However, the quality of this transformation can be different\nfor outliers and inliers. Missing outliers in scenarios where they are of\nparticular interest - such as healthcare, finance, or engineering - can be\ncostly or dangerous. Thus, ensuring good probabilities for outliers is\nessential. This paper argues that statistical scaling, as commonly used in the\nliterature, does not produce equally good probabilities for outliers as for\ninliers. Therefore, we propose robust statistical scaling, which uses robust\nestimators to improve the probabilities for outliers.

From a causal perspective, constraining the\nconsistency between different modalities can mine causal representations that\nconvey primary events. However, such simple consistency may face the risk of\nlearning insufficient or unnecessary information: a necessary but insufficient\ncause is invariant across modalities but may not have the required accuracy; a\nsufficient but unnecessary cause tends to adapt well to specific modalities but\nmay be hard to adapt to new data. To address this issue, in this paper, we aim\nto learn representations that are both causal sufficient and necessary, i.e.,\nCausal Complete Cause ($C^3$), for MML. Firstly, we define the concept of $C^3$\nfor MML, which reflects the probability of being causal sufficiency and\nnecessity. We also propose the identifiability and measurement of $C^3$, i.e.,\n$C^3$ risk, to ensure calculating the learned representations' $C^3$ scores in\npractice. Then, we theoretically prove the effectiveness of $C^3$ risk by\nestablishing the performance guarantee of MML with a tight generalization\nbound. Based on these theoretical results, we propose a plug-and-play method,\nnamely Causal Complete Cause Regularization ($C^3$R), to learn causal complete\nrepresentations by constraining the $C^3$ risk bound.

Particularly, we demonstrate that\nunder the conditions where the trajectory-wise reward is normalized between\nzero and one and the transition is time-homogenous, it achieves horizon-free\nand second-order bounds. Horizon-free means that our bounds have no polynomial\ndependence on the horizon of the Markov Decision Process. A second-order bound\nis a type of instance-dependent bound that scales with respect to the variances\nof the returns of the policies which can be small when the system is nearly\ndeterministic and (or) the optimal policy has small values. We highlight that\nour algorithms are simple, fairly standard, and indeed have been extensively\nstudied in the RL literature: they learn a model via MLE, build a version space\naround the MLE solution, and perform optimistic or pessimistic planning\ndepending on whether operating in the online or offline mode. These algorithms\ndo not rely on additional specialized algorithmic designs such as learning\nvariances and performing variance-weighted learning and thus can leverage rich\nfunction approximations that are significantly beyond linear or tabular\nstructures. The simplicity of the algorithms also implies that our horizon-free\nand second-order regret analysis is actually standard and mainly follows the\ngeneral framework of optimism/pessimism in the face of uncertainty.\n","authors":["Zhiyong Wang","Dongruo Zhou","John C.

To\novercome these challenges, researchers have investigated integrating physics\nprinciples into machine learning models, mainly through: (i) physics-guided\nloss functions, generally termed as physics-informed neural networks, and (ii)\nphysics-guided architectural design. While both approaches have demonstrated\nsuccess across multiple scientific disciplines, they have limitations including\nbeing trapped to a local minimum, poor interpretability, and restricted\ngeneralizability. This paper proposes a new physics-informed neural network\n(PINN) architecture that combines the strengths of both approaches by embedding\nthe fundamental solution of the wave equation into the network architecture,\nenabling the learned model to strictly satisfy the wave equation. The proposed\npoint neuron learning method can model an arbitrary sound field based on\nmicrophone observations without any dataset. Compared to other PINN methods,\nour approach directly processes complex numbers and offers better\ninterpretability and generalizability. We evaluate the versatility of the\nproposed architecture by a sound field reconstruction problem in a reverberant\nenvironment.

Fuzzing has been studied to uncover\ncompiler defects. However, compiler fuzzing remains challenging: Existing arts\nfocus on black- and grey-box fuzzing, which generates tests without sufficient\nunderstanding of internal compiler behaviors. Meanwhile, traditional white-box\ntechniques, like symbolic execution, are computationally inapplicable to the\ngiant codebase of compilers. Recent advances demonstrate that Large Language\nModels (LLMs) excel in code generation/understanding tasks.

However, the label scarcity problem is a main\nchallenge in this field, which limits the wide application of EEG-based emotion\nrecognition. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning\nframework (EEGMatch) to leverage both labeled and unlabeled EEG data. First, an\nEEG-Mixup based data augmentation method is developed to generate more valid\nsamples for model learning. Second, a semi-supervised two-step pairwise\nlearning method is proposed to bridge prototype-wise and instance-wise pairwise\nlearning, where the prototype-wise pairwise learning measures the global\nrelationship between EEG data and the prototypical representation of each\nemotion class and the instance-wise pairwise learning captures the local\nintrinsic relationship among EEG data. Third, a semi-supervised multi-domain\nadaptation is introduced to align the data representation among multiple\ndomains (labeled source domain, unlabeled source domain, and target domain),\nwhere the distribution mismatch is alleviated. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on two benchmark databases (SEED and SEED-IV) under a cross-subject\nleave-one-subject-out cross-validation evaluation protocol.
